# Selecting Zipcodes for analysis

Using the article listed above. One zipcode from each of the top 5 metro areas in the US is chosen for analysis. These 5 areas are chose based on their unemployment rate, per-capita GDP, and other factors which can be found in the article. From these 5 metro areas I found the three lowest selling prices for 2018-04. I then compared the average price in 2013 or as early as the data is found and 2018 and found the zipcode with the highest return. Time-series analysis modeling is provided for these 5 zipcodes.

Top 5 Metro Areas:
1. San Francisco
2. Austin
3. Seattle
4. Dallas
5. Boston
